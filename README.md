This is a comprehensive backend system for a software billing and e-commerce platform. It leverages Node.js, Express, and Mongoose to handle data and APIs, with Postman for API testing. The app is designed to serve multiple user roles (Admin, User, and Manager) with distinct permissions and functionalities managed by authentication and authorization middleware.

Functionalities
1. User Roles and Authentication
Roles:
Admin: Manages the platform, has full access to all CRUD operations.
User: Can perform specific actions like managing personal data, cart, wishlist, and purchasing products.
Manager: Handles managerial tasks with limited access compared to Admin.
Authentication:
Uses middleware to authenticate users before allowing access to protected routes.
Securely manages login and permissions using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
2. Billing and Purchase Management
Bill Management:
Admin and Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) billing records after authentication.
Purchasing Workflow:
Users can add items to their cart or directly purchase them.
Orders are processed securely through the API.
3. Product Management
Full CRUD operations for products.
Managed by Admin and Manager roles.
Each product has attributes such as name, description, price, stock quantity, etc.
4. Wishlist and Cart Management
Wishlist:
Users can add or remove products from their wishlist.
Provides an easy way to save items for later purchase.
Cart:
Users can add, update, and remove items in their cart.
Supports both single-item purchases and bulk checkout.
5. User Profile Management
Users can manage their personal information, including:
Adding, updating, and deleting addresses.
Updating profile details like name, email, and password.
Key Features
Role-based Access Control (RBAC):
Ensures that actions are limited based on the user's role.
Middleware:
Authentication middleware secures endpoints.
Authorization middleware restricts access based on roles.
Database Schema Design:
Efficient use of Mongoose models for entities like Users, Products, Orders, and Bills.
API Endpoints:
Fully tested using Postman for seamless integration and debugging.
Potential Extensions
Integration with a payment gateway for processing payments.
Adding analytics dashboards for Admins to track sales and user activity.
Implementation of email or SMS notifications for order updates.
This app demonstrates a solid understanding of backend development and showcases your expertise in managing role-based permissions, secure data handling, and creating scalable e-commerce systems.
